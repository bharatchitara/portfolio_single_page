        let me explain. I assumed you want your #header to stay fixed. so i pushed your left down (margin-top: 100px;) to push everything down, unfortunate, this also pushed down the #header, so i pulled it up (top: 0;)

So that solves your biggest problem. Now, if you scroll (i made your .right what higher) the #header stays on top. in order to centralize a fixed div, you need to add (besides margin: 0 auto; or margin: auto;) left: 0; and right: 0; (which i did)

then, imagine your screen has x and y coordinates (you should be familiar with that), the z-index is the axes which comes “out” of your screen. so the z-index decides which element is in front, if there is an overlap. that is what z-index does.
